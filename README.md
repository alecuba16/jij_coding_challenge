# Adevinta Spain Data Engineer Coding Challenge

Today and urgently, the Adevinta Spain CEO requested some vital information about published ads and sites at Adevinta Spain.

The Head of Data steps forward knowing that Adevinta Spain built a Data Lake and therefore the required information will be available in there.

There is only one problem: the Data Engineers are currently on a deserved long vacation and there is no one else left to accomplish this task.

The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) managed to extract the required data and after the approval from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) uploaded them in this link: [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/gumartinm/dataset).

Help the Head of Data to complete the task through the implementation of the next requirements.
